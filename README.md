# Gaza tweets analysis

*This project was part of NI-HCM course as a part of my masters studies at Faculty of Informatics, Czech Technical university under supervision of Ing. Josef Hol√Ω.*

This repository contains analysis of Twitter reaction to the Hamas attack on **7th October 2023**. Note that tweets only during first three days were scraped and the analysis would require an update for the current situation.

This repository only contains Jupyter notebook used to create topics from analyzed tweets along word clouds used for presentations. The presentation is available at faculty gitlab. For better understanding of current situation on *X* it would be better to repeat analysis using tweets from later period and compare to the obtained results.
